                                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melbourne Grammar School is a private secondary school in Melbourne, Australia. The school was established in 1858 and is one of the oldest schools in Australia.
                                    <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melbourne Grammar School is known for its high standard of educational quality and academic results, consistently ranking among the best in the college entrance examination. The school aims to guide each male student to self-discovery, self-cognition, leadership training, focusing on intellectual, emotional, mental, physical, social and spiritual all-round development, so that students can become a valuable person.

                                    In addition, Melbourne Grammar School alumni include many of Australia's leading politicians, community and business leaders, academics and athletes. The school is divided into Primary school (kindergarten to Grade 6), Secondary School (grades 7-8) and Senior School (grades 9-12), with a total of about 800 boys. When students move from middle school to high school, they enter a new challenging period and gradually become mature. In the last three years of high school, students are required to choose their best subjects from more than 40 VCE subjects to take the VCE college entrance examination.
